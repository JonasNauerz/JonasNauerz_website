I am a macroeconomist focusing on labor market questions, and I am particularly interested in the interaction between micro-level heterogeneity and the effects of economic policy.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Notre Dame. My <!-- {{< staticref "files/JMP.pdf" "newtab" >}}job market paper{{< /staticref >}}. --> job market paper studies the responses in labor force participation and output to a tax reform allowing for imperfect substitutability of male and female labor inputs.

I will be available for interviews during the EJME 2022 and the ASSA 2023 virtual meetings.
