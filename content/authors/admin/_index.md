I am a macroeconomist focusing on labor market questions, and I am particularly interested in the interaction between micro-level heterogeneity and the effects of economic policy.

Currently, I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in economics at the University of Notre Dame. Before joining Notre Dame, I graduated with an MSc in economics from the Stockholm School of Economics.
