I am a macroeconomist with broad interests in labor market questions and the effects of government policies on labor allocation. In particular, I am interested in how micro heterogeneity interacts with the macroeconomy and how it affects economic policy. 

Currently, I am a third year PhD student in Economics at the University of Notre Dame. Before joining Notre Dame, I graduated with a Master of Science in Economics from the Stockholm School of Economics and during my undergraduate studies at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, I spent a semester abroad at the University of Iceland in Reykjavik.
