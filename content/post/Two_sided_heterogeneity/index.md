title: Occupational Choice and Exposure to Business Cycles

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: We try to answer the following questions: If recessions are mainly driven by sector (or occupation) specific shocks, and as a result, income and employment opportunities of some individuals (groups) are affected more than others, can targeted taxes and transfers mitigate the adverse effects of business cycles acting as automatic stabilizers?

## Occupational Choice and Exposure to Business Cycles

abstract: 
Recessions are not uniform across demographic groups, and the sectoral and occupational composition of employment explains much of the differences in exposure. Furthermore, the relative importance of sector or region-specific shocks, compared to purely aggregate shocks, in determining business cycles has increased over time and is prominent today. We build a business cycle model with heterogeneous households and occupational choices to answer whether targeted taxes and transfers may mitigate or even alleviate the adverse effects of business cycles on the income and employment opportunities of those most affected. We leverage administrative taxpayer and matched employee-employer data to calibrate the model economy for Germany. Using the calibrated model, our focus is on whether targeted tax-transfers schemes can do better than schemes that only depend on income.
