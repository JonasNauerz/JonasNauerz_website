abstract: "Policies such as changes to income taxation and subsidized childcare that aim to increase the female labor supply are high on the agenda of policymakers and widely discussed among economists. Much of the macroeconomic analysis has focused on the direct effects of adding more (female) workers to the labor force by assuming that men and women are perfect substitutes in the production process. I develop a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents and family labor supply to consider the possibility of imperfect substitution. This choice is motivated by my empirical estimate of the elasticity of substitution between male and female labor inputs in modern-day Germany of 0.55. For identification, I exploit a natural experiment that induced exogenous time and county-level (Landkreise) variation in the availability of public daycare for children under the age of three. I study the implications of a reform that moves from joint taxation of married couples to individual taxation and find that it substantially affects the labor force participation of married women (+12.7%) and overall output (+7.4%). This result compares to an output increase of 3.27% in the perfect substitutability case. Thus, disregarding the added benefits of gender diversity underestimates the positive effects of such a policy change."

# summary: "I analyze the effects of a policy reform that moves from an income tax system in which married households are taxed jointly to one in which individuals are the unit of taxation. I consider the possibility of imperfect sustainability of male and female labor inputs in the production process based on empirical evidence I obtained exploiting a natural experiment in the availability of public daycare in Germany."
