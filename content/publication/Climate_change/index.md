summary: "We study the response of monthly U.S. dollar real exchange rates to global and country-specific temperature shocks and find large cross-sectional differences across country pairs. The real exchange rate is more likely to depreciate if the country is warmer, wealthier, more dependent on agriculture, less open and more dependent on tourism."

abstract: "We study the response of monthly U.S. dollar (USD) real exchange rates of 76 countries to global and country-specific temperature shocks. A positive global temperature shock yields statistically significant appreciations against the USD in 38 percent of the sample's countries and statistically significant depreciations in 17 percent of the countries. Four years after a positive 1 degree celclius increase in global temperature over its historical average, the Czech Republic currency appreciates by 6.4 percent against the USD. The determinants of response heterogeneity are studied by regressing local projection response coefficients on country characteristics. The real exchange rate is more likely to depreciate if the country is warmer, wealthier, more dependent on agriculture, less open and more dependent on tourism.""
